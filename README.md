# Stoabrogga's patches

Client experimentation; meant to be used together with [mod-stoabrogga](https://gitlab.com/opfesoft/mod-stoabrogga).

- Hearthstone cooldown 60s
- Ghost Wolf is usable indoors
- A few custom mounts/items/models
- Enable flying everywhere
- Increase height of the upper plane of the bounding box for flying (MFBO) in Draenei and Blood Elf areas (no "hiccups" anymore if flying there)
